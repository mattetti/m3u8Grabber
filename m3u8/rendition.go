	// created, the BANDWIDTH value MUST be the largest sum of peak segment
	// bit rates that is produced by any playable combination of Renditions.
	// (For a Variant Stream with a single Media Playlist, this is just the
	// peak segment bit rate of that Media Playlist.)  An inaccurate value
	// can cause playback stalls or prevent clients from playing the
	// variant.
	//
	// If the Master Playlist is to be made available before all Media
	// Segments in the presentation have been encoded, the BANDWIDTH value
	// SHOULD be the BANDWIDTH value of a representative period of similar
	// content, encoded using the same settings.

	// at which to display all the video in the Variant Stream.

	// that SHOULD be used when playing the presentation. (optional)

	// frame rate for all the video in the Variant Stream, rounded to 3 decimal
	// places. The FRAME-RATE attribute is OPTIONAL but is recommended if the
